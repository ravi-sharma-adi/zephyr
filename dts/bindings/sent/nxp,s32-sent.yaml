  properties:
    num-data-nibbles:
      type: int
      enum:
        - 1
        - 2
        - 3
        - 4
        - 5
        - 6
        - 7
        - 8
      required: true
      description: |
        Specifies the number of data nibbles. A nibble is a four-bit aggregation.
        This property defines how many such nibbles are used in the data transmission.

    tick-time-prescaler-us:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Specifies the tick time prescaler in microseconds (us). This value determines the
        base time unit for the system's timing operations, effectively setting the resolution
        of the timer.

    bus-timeout-cycles:
      type: int
      required: true
      enum:
        - 0
        - 256
        - 512
        - 1024
        - 2048
      description: |
        Specifies the number of bus timeout cycles. This value determines the maximum number
        of cycles the bus will wait before timing out.

    calib-method-low-latency:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Indicates whether the successive calibration pulse check method with low latency is enabled.
        This method ensures faster calibration by reducing the delay between successive pulses.

    slow-crc-no-data-nibble-xor:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Indicates whether the slow message CRC implementation avoids using the zero data nibble
        XOR method. When set to true, the CRC calculation will not include the XOR operation
        with zero data nibbles.

    fast-crc-no-data-nibble-xor:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Indicates whether the fast message CRC implementation avoids using the zero data nibble
        XOR method. When set to true, the CRC calculation will not include the XOR operation
        with zero data nibbles.

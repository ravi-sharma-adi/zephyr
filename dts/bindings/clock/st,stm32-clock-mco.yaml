        STM32 Microcontroller Clock Output (MCO)

        Used to output a clock signal from the MCU to a GPIO pin.
        The selected signal goes through a configurable prescaler before output.
        The clocks property defines the MCOx source clock. Several are possible
        for MCO1 and/or MCO2 depending on the stm32 serie.
        The prescaler is directly the value from 1 to n depending on the stm32 serie
        and will be converted in LL_RCC_MCO2_DIV_n

        Example:
                &mco1 {
                        clocks = <&rcc STM32_SRC_LSE MCO1_SEL(7)>;
                        prescaler = <5>;
                        pinctrl-0 = <&rcc_mco_pa8>;
                        pinctrl-names = "default";
                        status = "okay";
                };

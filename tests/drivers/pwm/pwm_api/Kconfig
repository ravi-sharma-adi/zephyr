config ENABLE_TIMING_CHECK
	bool "Enable PWM timing check with GPIO and systimer"
	help
		Enables timing checks on PWM signals by using a GPIO pin and interrupts
		along with the system timer to automatically measure period and duty cycle.
		Assumes the system timer is accurate and uses it as reference tick.

config ALLOWED_DEVIATION
	int "Allowed deviation (%) for PWM timing checks"
	default 5
	range 0 100
	help
		Maximum allowed deviation (%) from the programmed values for the test to be
		considered a PASS. For example, if set to 5, the measured period or duty cycle
		can deviate by up to 5% from the programmed values for the test to pass.

config TEST_DELAY
	int "Test delay duration (ms)"
	default 1000
	help
		Sets delay duration in milliseconds for testing purposes.
		It configures the delay period in between test cases.
